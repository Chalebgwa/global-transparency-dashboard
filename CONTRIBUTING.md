# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Global Transparency Dashboard! This guide outlines our preferred workflow and conventions.

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch with a descriptive name, e.g. `feature/my-chart` or `fix/data-fetch`.
3. Make your changes and commit with concise messages (see below).
4. Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`.
5. Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting a review.

## Code Style
- Use 2â€‘space indentation for JavaScript/TypeScript files.
- Run any available linters or formatters before committing.
- Include tests when adding new features if possible.

## Commit Messages
- Start with a verb such as `Add`, `Fix`, or `Update`.
- Keep the first line under 72 characters.
- Provide enough detail to explain the intent of the change.

## Branch Naming
- `feature/<short-description>` for new features.
- `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes or maintenance.

We appreciate your contributions and welcome new ideas!
