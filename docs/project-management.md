# Project Management

This document outlines how we manage tasks and track progress for the Global Transparency Dashboard project.

## GitHub Project Board

We use a GitHub Project Board to track all work items through their lifecycle. The project board can be found at: [Global Transparency Dashboard Project](https://github.com/users/Chalebgwa/projects/1)

### Columns

- **üìã Backlog**: New issues that haven't been triaged yet
- **üîç Ready**: Issues that are ready to be worked on
- **üèóÔ∏è In Progress**: Issues currently being worked on
- **üëÄ In Review**: Issues with open pull requests pending review
- **‚úÖ Done**: Completed issues

### Automation

The project board is configured with automation to:
- Move issues to "In Progress" when a PR is opened that references the issue
- Move issues to "In Review" when a PR is ready for review
- Move issues to "Done" when the PR is merged

## Project Phases

Our development is organized into 4 main phases:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (Weeks 1-4)
- Finalize MVP scope & data sources
- Validate APIs & sample data
- Architecture diagram & sprint plan

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Weeks 5-16)
- Data ingestion scripts (Node.js)

- REST API (Swagger)
- Frontend MVP (React)
- Unit tests & accessibility review

### Phase 3: Beta Launch (Weeks 17-20)
- Private beta release to NGOs, researchers
- Collect feedback & bug reports
- v0.1 public release

### Phase 4: Iteration & Polish (Weeks 21-24)
